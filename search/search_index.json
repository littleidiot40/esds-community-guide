It is expected that this document serves as a blueprint for existing forthcoming open source software development efforts undertaken by the EOSDIS community. This process is inspired and influenced by \u201cthe Apache Way\u201d practiced by the Apache Software Foundation but is tailored to EOSDIS specific needs and communication patterns. Goals of this Document \u00b6 Establish criteria for projects to be considered for this process Establish roles and responsibilities for contributions to NASA EOSDIS software Identify key communication flows, as well as information on documentation, testing and deployment paradigms Outline high-level process expectations for contributions and provide example process flows for these contributions What Projects are Appropriate for this Process? \u00b6 A project in this context represents a system of software elements that are being developed to fulfill a system need for EOSDIS (e.g. the Common Metadata Repository, Cumulus, GIBS). The word system may be used throughout this document interchangeably with the word project . Assumptions \u00b6 It is assumed that each project guided by this document has already established best practices based on NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7150.2B In addition, there are several additional elements that should be in place before establishing the roles and processes described below: Code is already open source approved and publicly available[^1] Development is being conducted in publicly available software repositories (e.g. gitlab, github) Process is in place to allow for continuous integration . A suite of regression tests is available and can be run by external contributors The project has an existing documented policy/process for setting vision and roadmaps, tracking releases, and deployments. Deployment instructions for the software is well documented to facilitate collaboration and reproducible installations. Code Contribution: Roles and Responsibilities \u00b6 Project Structure: This diagram lays out the relationships between the various roles in the team, showing how each role interacts as a high level Users \u00b6 Users are any end-users, operators, or monitors of the software system. Responsibilities \u00b6 Using the software Providing bug reports and new feature requests via appropriate processes as documented by Technical Leadership Team Providing feedback to Project Leadership Team on proposed new features and testing fixes Project Management Board (PMB) \u00b6 The project management board is a group of 3-7 individuals representing various stakeholders of the software system at various levels including DAAC and ESDIS members. A member of the Project Leadership Team (PLT) serves as the chair of this board and is in charge of populating the board. Responsibilities \u00b6 Setting overall project direction and policy for the project Designating specific components of the system for inclusion in the centralized governance policy (laid out by this document) Conducting monthly reviews of the project processes and status. Conducting less-frequent, periodic, and holistic system reviews, including soliciting third party reviews of the system for usability, affordability, and security as needed Conducting periodic surveys of users to increase effectiveness of the system Continually monitoring and reporting on the vitality of the project via metrics such as: Number of code contributions from DAACs, ESDIS, external sources Number of community members and their related affiliation and role Interacting with Project Leadership Team (PLT) to discuss issues of importance Approving Technical Leadership Team members Approving promotion of project contributors to committers under advisement from PLT and TLT Project Manager (PM) \u00b6 The project shall have a NASA Civil Servant designated as the overall project manager. The PM will be the overall decision maker for the project. This role ensures no conflicts of interest with existing contracts or other external entities seeking to influence system functionality. Specifically this PM will deal with decisions related to significant contributions from external contributors. (See the specific section of this document related to External Contributions for more details) The PM will serve as the chair of the PMB and will be part of the Project Leadership Team (PLT) and fulfill responsibilities outlined for that role. Project Leadership Team (PLT) \u00b6 The project leadership team (PLT) consists of 1-2 overall system leads (one of whom is the Project Manager) who work closely with the PMB and Technical Leadership Team (TLT) to oversee system development and deployment. Responsibilities \u00b6 Interacting closely with the PMB advising on system direction, as well as shifts in technical team membership and processes Working on sprint planning and reviews with committers, ensuring all work aligns with system direction Working with the TLT to determine release cycle and versioning updates Keeping project schedule updated and reporting status to PMB as requested Maintaining project requirements baselines as needed Communicating status to EOSDIS, ESDIS leadership and HQ as requested Recommending technical leadership team members to the PMB Recommending contributors/developers promotion to committers/reviewers to the PMB Inviting and appointing members of the PMB. Maintaining contribution guidelines (this document) Fulfilling the \"Product Owner\" role of a scrum. Act as point of contact for ESDIS-funded DAACs who request new features or introduce high-priority issues/bugs Technical Leadership Team (TLT) \u00b6 The TLT consists of 1-2 technical leads who work closely with the project leadership team and committers/reviewers to maintain the technical integrity, quality, stability, and direction of the system. The TLT may or may not also be a member of the PLT or PMB and may or may not be a committer/reviewer on the system. Responsibilities \u00b6 Interacting closely with the PLT, advising on technical direction, as well as shifts in technical team membership and processes Conducting periodic technical reviews of the system and process Ensuring code quality, technical integrity, system stability, development progress, and smooth deployment into target environment Developing and maintaining documentation of style guides, best practices, and code quality expectations to be utilized by Committers and Contributors. Working with the PLT to determine release cycle and versioning updates Documenting release cycle and versioning updates Working with the PLT in specifying, documenting, and maintaining tools to be used for code development, system documentation, issue tracking, testing, continuous integration, automation activities and deployment (e.g. JIRA/Github/Circle CI/Bamboo/Wiki) Recommending contributors/developers promotion to committers/reviewers to the PLT Fulfilling the \"System Architect\" (and Scrum Master) role(s) of an agile organization. Committers \u00b6 These members of the team do all code merges into the main project repositories. All merged code must have undergone review by at least one other committer. All committers to the project codebases must be directly NASA-funded. Responsibilities \u00b6 Working with TLT to develop and execute sprint plans based on TLT direction Fixing and testing bugs Participating in daily/weekly scrum meetings to discuss development progress and issues. Reviewing code/documentation contributions from other committers and contributors, ensuring compliance with style guides, technical roadmap and code quality expectations Maintaining documentation of code processes and API changes Working with deployment team to ensure smooth testing delivery of releases Integrating contributions from contributors into baseline Contributing code/tests/documentation in accordance with style guides, technical roadmap and code quality expectations outlined by the TLT Contributors \u00b6 These members of the team may contribute code, documentation, containerized libraries, and examples to the system but may not merge any changes to the repository baselines. Contributors are not expected to execute on sprint plans, participate in scrums, or contribute critical functionality to the system. Contributors are not necessarily NASA-funded. NASA-funded contributors may be promoted to committers via the PMB if it makes sense to do so and they are recommended by both the TLT and PLT. Responsibilities \u00b6 Contributing and justifying code/tests/documentation in accordance with style guides, technical roadmap and code quality expectations outlined by the TLT Identifying, troubleshooting, fixing test failures and submitting bug fixes. External Contributions, Community Engagement and Outreach \u00b6 It is the responsibility of the Project Manager to act as the primary point of contact for external contributors seeking to contribute to or modify the system in a significant way[^2]. Furthermore, the PM will work with the PMB and the PLT to develop strategies for community engagement and outreach for the project. Communication \u00b6 All meeting minutes, actions, and notes should be kept in the Earthdata wiki under the specific project space. From time to time, mail may be used for ongoing community discussions, system-wide announcements, release tracking, feedback solicitation, etc. The project should maintain a mailing list ( e.g. cumulus-all@lists.nasa.gov ) to facilitate broad communication within the community. All stakeholders should be subscribed to the project\u2019s mailing list. EOSDIS project users, contributors, committers, and members of the TLT, PLT, and PMB are all encouraged to utilize Slack for day-to-day discussion and non-sensitive interactions. However, Slack SHALL NOT be used for documenting decision making. Slack is not an official NASA, or ESDIS-approved, endorsed tool. Only Public Access and Administrative Information is allowed in Slack, neither ITAR nor SBU information is appropriate for this service. Decisions on project direction, meeting notes from team meetings or PMB communications should be published as soon as feasible to a public facing site, such as the wiki. Communication for the PMB, PLT, and TLT should be free-flowing and ad-hoc via all channels mentioned above and should include more formal, monthly meetings of the full group. Documentation \u00b6 Code quality, coding standards, test coverage, continuous integration processes, API documentation are all the purview of the PLT and TLT and shall be documented in the project wiki, or via README files within the repository. Testing \u00b6 While it is expected that the projects utilizing this process will leverage automated test technologies and continuous integration techniques, specific testing policies and practices are determined and documented by the Technical Leadership Team (TLT). Testing policy should be enforced by committers and the TLT via code review and approvals. This policy will be available in the project wiki, or via README files within the repository. Deployment Environments and Releases \u00b6 The Technical Leadership Team will work with the Project Leadership Team to determine the best timelines for new releases of the system. System releases should allow enough time for extensive testing and will maintain backwards compatibility with existing configured products. Each system release for ESDIS production usage should progress through a Systems Integration Test (SIT) environment, and a User Acceptance Test (UAT) environment prior to general release to public facing production environments. If deemed necessary by the TLT/PLT team, release will also undergo load/performance testing. As mentioned in the Assumptions subsection of this document, each project adhering to this process should have a well-documented and maintained release, test, and deployment process. Code of Conduct \u00b6 Software system development is a highly collaborative endeavor and open source projects even more so. \u201cA code of conduct is necessary so members of an organization or group understand the standards they will be expected to uphold when interacting with each other and others outside the organization.\u201d ^3 Team members agree to abide by the Contributor Covenant as outlined here: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html Security \u00b6 All public facing EOSDIS projects covered by this document should follow a unified security policy. This security policy is meant to cover a wide-variety of topics including, but not limited to: Automated Tooling Developer Best Practices Process documentation Communication Patterns Risk Tolerance This security policy document will be covered by EOSDIS configuration management and will maintain an active copy in the Earthdata wiki. Project Closeout \u00b6 Eventually, all projects tend to be retired and replaced by new initiatives and technologies. Software is especially prone to obsolescence and therefore special attention should be paid to the proper retirement process. Each project should develop a close-out plan focused on retiring production usage of the project within EOSDIS and notification of external stakeholders of the close-out. This plan should include elements such as: Code base retirement and decommissioning Stakeholder communication Smooth transition to new technology as needed The following is a helpful resource when considering shuttering a project: https://github.com/todogroup/guides/blob/master/shutting-down-an-open-source-project.md \u00b6 Example Scenarios and FAQ \u00b6 Contribution and promotion of code/documentation to repository \u00b6 Example Workflow: Codebase Changes from both internal and external contributors. How can I become a committer? (Meritocracy) \u00b6 While this project\u2019s vision is set by the PMB and executed by the PLT and TLT, individual contributors (who are funded by NASA) may be promoted to committers assuming they have garnered the respect within the project through their contributions and are willing to step into that role. As in the Apache Software Foundation, newcomers and contributors are seen as volunteers that want to help and are devoted to seeing the project realize its vision. Does this project follow Agile processes for development? \u00b6 Probably. Generally EOSDIS employs agile processes. While Users and Contributors are not expected to participate in scrum and sprint planning activities, it is assumed that they will be aware of such processes in use by committers and other project leadership roles Who manages/controls determining what changes will be applied to the project\u2019s codebases? \u00b6 The Project Manager will review and ultimately act as decision maker on large functionality changes and re-architecting of the system. This will be done with advisement of the PMB, TLT and other EOSDIS leadership. Can we contribute code written by others to this repository? Or can we merge third party open source software into the codebase? \u00b6 This is dependent on the license used by the specific project. If the project is released with the Apache 2.0 license , it allows contributions from third party open source software assuming they are utilizing proper licensing and is approved by the TLT and PLT. Please refer to the specific license for more information. Can I fork this repository and make my own project? \u00b6 Yes. We encourage forking as a model for contributing to the code base. However, when approaching the idea of creating a permanent fork of the repository maintained by a separate organization and group to add new functionality or change architecture, we strongly urge you to work with the Project Management Board and the Technical Lead to find a way to merge your changes/additions back into the main repository. Is there a coding style guide available? \u00b6 Yes. Coding style guide is specified and maintained by the TLT and outside the scope of this document. If I want to contribute, do I need to enter into an CCLA/ICLA ? \u00b6 The short answer is: maybe. NASA\u2019s Patent Counsel can provide guidance for specific scenarios. If you are contributing code on your personal time, whether a government employee, contractor, or funded collaborator, please contact the project management board to discuss. Can we create add-on modules to the project codebase? \u00b6 Yes. Contact the PM and PLT for information and guidance. Will DAACs have to control/manage changes to their added project modules? \u00b6 Yes, DAACs will have a contact to control the changes to the codebase for the modules they are responsible for and will follow the same process outlined for core project code changes. If your proposed module is rejected what are your options? \u00b6 If a module is ultimately rejected from being included in the project or as an add-on module, that only means that the PM/PLT does not think it\u2019s applicable to the project codebase, it can be built/deployed/contributed to as an independent project/module in the ECC or via other source code repositories Do developers need to provide good, concise, complete descriptions of the capabilities of their developed modules? \u00b6 YES. Documentation is vital and should be maintained within the project\u2019s wiki space. \u00b6 Acronyms/Glossary \u00b6 API Application Programming Interface CI Continuous Integration CLA \\ (ICLA, CCLA) Contributor License Agreement, often individual (ICLA) or commercial (CCLA) https://www.clahub.com/pages/why_cla DAAC Distributed Active Archive Center EC2 Elastic Compute Cluster EOSDIS Earth Observing System Data and Information System ESDIS Earth Science Data and Information Systems NGAP NASA Compliant General Application Platform PM Project Manager (a NASA civil servant) PMB Project Management Board PLT Project Leadership Team TLT Technical Leadership Team SAFe\u00ae Scaled Agile Framework\u00ae https://www.scaledagileframework.com/ \\ (SAFe and Scaled Agile Framework are registered trademarks of Scaled Agile, Inc.)
